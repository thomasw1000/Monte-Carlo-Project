# Monte-Carlo-Project
I wrote this program in the second year of my Physics degree as part of a computing module I undertook. This project shows a combination of computing and statistical methods in order to evaluate the value of $ln(2)$.
This is achieved using the fact that the area under the curve $1/(x+1)$ is given by $ln(2)$ on the interval $[0,1]$. Thus, if several points are randomly generated in the unit square, the proportion under the curve will give the required value.
